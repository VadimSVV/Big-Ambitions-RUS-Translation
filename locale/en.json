    "uncle_fred_tutorial_3" : "Kid. I've gone ahead and paid your first month's rent, but that's it, okay, you need to get out there and get a job. Anything at all. You just need a salary right now.",

Look, if you need a loan to start something, I got a friend over at Jensen Capital. His name is Larry. That's who you ask for. And be sure to say hi from me your Uncle Fred. Okay?",

    "uncle_fred_tutorial_9" : "Well, look at who's the boss. You did a good job on that hire kid. I know having an employee takes a big cut out of what you're taking in, but it also gives you extra time. Time to start cleaning up these floors. Oh, man, they're a bit nasty.",

And by the way, you know, you don't build an entire empire with just a gift shop, right? I think you should consider opening a new business. That said, you don't want to go rushing into something willy-nilly. You got to know what people want. There's an app for that. MarketInsider app. See what people are looking for.",
    "uncle_fred_tutorial_13" : "Now, you know, in business we always research a market before we go into it. You'll never get rich by supplying products that aren't in demand. Before you start your next business, make sure to get the Business Administration diploma at the school.",

    "uncle_fred_tutorial_17" : "Beautiful! Make sure to keep popularity high for all your businesses. Sometimes you might have to increase your marketing budget to gain the same results. The market changes every day.<br><br>I'm going to visit my vacation residence in Costa Del Sol. When I get back, I hope to see you have increased your daily income. It's time to take your empire to the next level, but we need more money first!",
    "uncle_fred_tutorial_18" : "Hey, kid, you got to come see my new villa in Marbella. We'll drink some sangria together some day. It's amazing. Anyways, I'm glad to see you've figured out how to increase your profit. Our next move is all about cutting out the middleman, the wholesaler. We got to start importing our products ourselves.",
    "uncle_fred_tutorial_19" : "Congratulations on your new headquarters! This is where the top employees of your organization will be seated. First, we have to start hiring. We need a Purchasing Agent to help us secure some import contracts.",
    "uncle_fred_tutorial_20" : "Ahh, progress! Your first operational employee working from your brand new headquarters. Starting to sound pretty fancy, huh? Now we need to get your purchasing agent working. But first, we need a place to store all your imported products.",
    "uncle_fred_tutorial_21" : "This is excellent. We'll use this warehouse to store your products until we can get them into your stores. We'll get back to that later. But now let's start stocking up these beautiful new shelves.",
    "uncle_fred_tutorial_22" : "So your warehouse is just jammed with products. We're at the last part, getting that stuff out of your warehouse and into your stores. So let's get busy.",
    "uncle_fred_tutorial_23" : "You're doing great, kid. I am very impressed. In fact, I think I should back off a little bit, give you more space so you can continue building up your retail empire on your own.",
